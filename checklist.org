* Data analysis tasks
 - figure out what else to put here

** Packet capture [0/1]

* Notes
** Monitor mode for intel
 - service network-manager stop
 - killall wpa_supplicant
 - use iw to add interface
  - iw phy del wlan0 (maybe?)
  - iw phy phy0 interface add mon0 type monitor <flags> (probably want fcsfail and some other stuff)
  - ifup mon0
  - now you have a sorta monitor mon0 wifi thing
