* Data Capture Tasks

** Surface [2/2]
 - [X] 80MHz vs 40MHz Indoor
 - [X] 80MHz vs 40MHz Clear

** Macbook [3/3]
  - [X] 80MHz vs 40MHz Indoor
  - [X] 80MHz vs 40MHz Clear
  - [X] solo indoor capture

** Intel [2/4]
 - [X] 80MHz vs 40MHz Indoor
 - [X] 80MHz vs 40MHz Clear
 - [ ] MCS 8/9 vs 6/7 Indoor if possible
 - [ ] MCS 8/9 vs 6/7 Clear if possible

* Data analysis tasks
** [Sean] 80 vs 40 thru walls (storage) [0/1]
 - [ ] check on dbm
 - [ ] figure out whats going on?

** [David] graph dbm at indoor locations 80vs40 [2/4]
 - [X] pull out dbm for intel
 - [ ] pull out dbm for macbook
 - [X] write script to generate avg and error bars
 - [ ] make graphs

** [David] graph beamform data [3/3]
 - [X] make intel graphs
 - [X] make macbook graphs
 - [X] talk about beamforming

** [Jake] iperf data [2/2]
 - [X] Parse out data
 - [X] generate avgs and variance


* Report
** TODO From Alex
 - [ ] mcs usage by location
 - [ ] hold MCS constant, graph tcp throughput (filter on mcs)
** Introduction
** Background [Sean]
*** Wifi Proliferation
*** Previous Standards
*** IEEE 802.11ac
  - What it fixes
  - What it adds
  - Where we are today with ac
*** Future of WiFi
** Related Work [David]
** Methods [All]
** Results [All]
*** Beamforming Analysis
*** Channel Width Analysis
*** MCS 8 & 9 Analysis
*** TCP Congestion Control over 802.11ac
  - OS X 10.10.2
  - Linux 3.19
  - Windows 8.1
*** iPerf Throughput Analysis
** Further Work & Conclusion

* Notes
** Indoor Distances (according to trig)
 - wall:226.05 inches
 - water:277.91 inches
 - storage:617.16 inches
** Monitor mode for intel
 - service network-manager stop
 - killall wpa_supplicant
 - use iw to add interface
  - iw phy del wlan0 (maybe?)
  - iw phy phy0 interface add mon0 type monitor <flags> (probably want fcsfail and some other stuff)
  - ifup mon0
  - now you have a sorta monitor mon0 wifi thing

** Self Capture on OS X
 - airport -c 48
 - tcpdump -I -i en0 -P -w filename.pcap
