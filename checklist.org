 - [X] 80MHz vs 40MHz Clear
 - [ ] MCS 8/9 vs 6/7 Indoor if possible
 - [ ] MCS 8/9 vs 6/7 Clear if possible

* Data analysis tasks
** [Sean] 80 vs 40 thru walls (storage) [0/1]
 - [ ] check on dbm
 - [ ] figure out whats going on?

** [David] graph dbm at indoor locations 80vs40 [2/4]
 - [X] pull out dbm for intel
 - [ ] pull out dbm for macbook
 - [X] write script to generate avg and error bars
 - [ ] make graphs

** [David] graph beamform data [0/3]
 - [ ] make intel graphs
 - [ ] make macbook graphs
 - [ ] talk about beamforming

** [Jake] iperf data [0/2]
 - [ ] Parse out data
 - [ ] generate avgs and variance

  - Windows 8.1
*** iPerf Throughput Analysis
** Further Work & Conclusion

* Notes
** Monitor mode for intel
 - service network-manager stop
 - killall wpa_supplicant
 - use iw to add interface
  - iw phy del wlan0 (maybe?)
  - iw phy phy0 interface add mon0 type monitor <flags> (probably want fcsfail and some other stuff)
  - ifup mon0
  - now you have a sorta monitor mon0 wifi thing

** Self Capture on OS X
 - airport -c 48
 - tcpdump -I -i en0 -P -w filename.pcap
