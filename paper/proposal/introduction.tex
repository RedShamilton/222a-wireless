This project proposes to characterize the performance and behavior of the new IEEE 802.11AC WiFi standard in typical situations that WiFi is regularly used in. The project will test 802.11AC in a RF crowded environment with various other WiFi networks competing for spectrum to include when neighbor networks are on the same channel and overlapping channels. The performance of the new Very High Throughput (VHT) 80MHz channel that is available with 802.11AC will be tested in these environment to measure the average real-world data rates that are achieved and the effects of operating an 80 MHz network on neighboring networks. Modern access points that implement the new standard also provide performance enhancing features such as Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) antenna arrays and beam forming to increase the signal to noise (S/N) ratio to a limited number of clients. These features will also be tested to observe how the performance of the network is affected, if at all, when these advanced techniques are employed.
