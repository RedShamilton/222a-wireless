A description of any resources you believe you will need to complete the assignment, such as access to testbeds, software, hardware resources, etc. We expect most of you will be able to complete your projects on resources already available to you, but if you have some particular needs please call them out and we'll see what we can do. Note that if the successful completion of your project depends on these (as opposed to ``it would be nice if'') please make sure you discuss this with Bhanu and/or the instructor before submitting.
