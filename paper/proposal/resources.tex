At current, we have access to two 802.11AC WAPs (although one is running the
internet at Sean's house, and can't be moved too frequently). Additionally, we
have a number of devices that can act as 802.11AC clients, including a Macbook
Pro, a Microsoft Surface Pro 3, and two mobile devices, an iPhone 6 and an
Android OnePlus One. Through these devices would be sufficient to test
application level congestion for a single WAP, we would like to test congestion
across multiple networks from several WAPs, so additional 802.11AC capable WAPs
would be required. To measure interference between 802.11b/g/n and AC, we
understood from Bhanu that there was an existing test bed of 802.11b/g/n WAPs
that could be used.
