\section{Schedule}


Going forward, our new expectation is to:

\subsection{Mar. 12}
Have run most of our testing, this will happen as we can get it
done. With our new testing infrastructure hopefully this can occur
nearly every day.

\subsection{Final}
Comparison and analysis of new 802.11ac feature performance in expectation vs reality.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 80MHz vs 40MHz peformance over distance and obstacles in reality vs theory
\item Throughput of new modulation schemes vs older ones.
\item SU-MIMO reality results, including how often and when our WAP will do this
\end{enumerate}
