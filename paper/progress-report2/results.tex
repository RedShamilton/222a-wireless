\section{Results}
Well we don't have much here, since we are just getting the new testing running.
\\
See figure \ref{fig} for some very brief version of our 80MHz vs
40MHz testing. This is just the raw times, as we haven't analyzed the
rest of the capture data yet. We have also ran into some interesting findings
with the difference in throughput between OS X clients and Linux clients for TCP
that we currently believe are specific to the OS's TCP implementation. Another issue
we have ran into with the equipment, we think, is a buffer queuing issue. When we
perform the iperf tests using UDP we experience a significant amount of lost packets.
However, we are not entirely sure about this yet because when we throttle the bandwidth down
to a figure where no dropping should occur, we still observe dropping of 40-50 percent.
