%\section{Schedule}

%A schedule, specifying concretely what you intend to have accomplished by each
%of the two milestones below as well as for the final report/presentation. It is
%perfectly acceptable if the final deliverable is not a completion of the
%project---which, if successful, some members of the group may wish to continue
%after the term ends---but it does need to be something that can be clearly
%demonstrated/evaluated/graded.

Our original goals have (as we discussed) had to change. This will outline (briefly) what we hope to have done for the presentation and talk.
Obviously its less than we would have preferred, but we have less time than we would've liked to run these experiments.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Test throughput as a function of distance for the new 80MHz bandwidth and compare to the 20/40Mhz bandwidth options that were defined in 802.11g and n standard
\item Provide a theoretical analysis of throughput for 160Mz channel bandwidth as a function of distance (Our equipment doesn't support 160MHz)
\item Test throughput for the newer modulation 256QAM modulation scheme and the two accompanying FEC codings (MCS 8 and 9)
\item Test and analyze the throughput and parallelism of MU-MIMO that is supported in 802.11ac
\end{enumerate}
