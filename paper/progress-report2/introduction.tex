%\section{Schedule}

%A schedule, specifying concretely what you intend to have accomplished by each
%of the two milestones below as well as for the final report/presentation. It is
%perfectly acceptable if the final deliverable is not a completion of the
%project---which, if successful, some members of the group may wish to continue
%after the term ends---but it does need to be something that can be clearly
%demonstrated/evaluated/graded.

Our original goals have (as we discussed) had to change. This will outline (briefly) what we hope to have done for the presentation and talk.
Obviously its less than we would have preferred, but we have less time than we would've liked to run these experiments.
