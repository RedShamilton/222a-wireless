\section{Tools}

We have decided to use iperf3 with TCP to measure bandwidth and
characteristics between machines in our network. Our testing has shown
that running \texttt{iperf3} on the router causes a significant
performance impact. We have setup several laptops as \texttt{iperf3}
servers for use during testing. Additionally we've written wrappers
for iperf to help with automated logging.

We've also built a custom multicast utility for helping us synchronize
our traces of MU-MIMO tests. We hope to use this to definitively show
that MU-MIMO is occuring when we claim it is, as well as accounting
for any clockskew.
