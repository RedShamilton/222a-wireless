\section{Discussion}

The surface was seen to outperform the other systems in the indoor test at the furtherest location. These results did not make any sense to us so we did some investigation into the packet captures. The Surface consistently sent at MCS indicies 4 and 5 using two spatial streams for a theorectical data rate of 490 Mbps. The Intel card always sent at MCS index 2 with only 1 spatial stream for a theorectical data rate of 83 Mbps. This accounts for the difference in throughput between these two devices however the Mac was a special case. It used an MCS of 4 and 5 like the Surface but used 2 and 3 spatial streams consistently. However, the performance was hindered drasitically by the amount of TCP restransmits that it recieved. Unfortunately we did not caputure on the AP but we believe that the ACKs were not making it back to the AP when the Mac transmitted them. There were no retransmits at the 802.11 MAC layer so this indicated that the packet was resent by the other endpoint based on a timeout and the ACK packets sent by the Mac were unforntunely not captured to verify this behavior. The Mac also had performance issues when capturing its own packets and this appears to affect the througput and timing such as turn around time for sending ACKs. One other percularity that both the Mac and Intel exhibited was the receive window size keep growing to a large value, where as on the Surface this value remained at 64K at all times. Once again, we did not capture packets at the other endpoint or AP so we were not able to resolve why this behavior was occuring exactly.
