\section{Conclude}
Wireless measurement is difficult. Changing environmental factors and
lack of device introspection make drawing serious conclusions nearly
impossible with the current state of 802.11ac consumer products.

We have shown, however, that 80MHz channel widths perform
approximately as expected, increasing received signal strength both
indoors and outdoors, and increasing the maximum connection distance.
Unfortunately, most devices experience a net throughput reduction with
80MHz in the longest distance scenarios due to a combination of MCS
choice and a reduction (in the case of the Macbook and the Intel 7260)
to a single spatial stream under 80MHz.
