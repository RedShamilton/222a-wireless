\section{Introduction}
802.11AC is the most recently commercially available update to the
802.11 wireless family. We present measurements of real-world
performance for 802.11AC devices in multiple settings, with two
different channel configurations. Unfortunately our measurements have
too little data, and much of it is of questionable quality. Current
802.11ac clients support only a few of the new standards, and almost
no low-level driver hacking is currently available. High quality
802.11ac client measurement will likely need to wait until the device
selection and drivers improve.
