%\section{Schedule}

%A schedule, specifying concretely what you intend to have accomplished by each
%of the two milestones below as well as for the final report/presentation. It is
%perfectly acceptable if the final deliverable is not a completion of the
%project---which, if successful, some members of the group may wish to continue
%after the term ends---but it does need to be something that can be clearly
%demonstrated/evaluated/graded.

Our original goals to be completed by February 19 were to have:

\begin{enumerate}
\item All hardware in-hand, cataloged, and tested. We will have documented all the listed features and performance of all devices we will be testing.
\item A testing suite, with associated metrics and benchmarking tools.
\item Preliminary results from running the testing tools on our 802.11ac and 802.11 g/n networks in isolation (no notable RF interference)
\end{enumerate}

We have completed these goals, and are on track for our subsequent deadlines.
