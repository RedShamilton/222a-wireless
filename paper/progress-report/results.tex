\section{Results}
We've included a very basic summary of the benchmarking data we
obtained for our macbook client. The data isn't particularly
interesting, and we will be re-running these tests in other
environments. Specifically, we will re-run these tests in:
\begin{itemize}
\item An open outdoor area (we are working how how to get power to this)
\item The UCSD CSE building
\item An apartment complex
\end{itemize}
