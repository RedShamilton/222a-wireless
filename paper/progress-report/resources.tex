%TODO
We have a working 2.4/5GHz spectrum analyzer. We've used it to observe
active networks, and to confirm that our testing location had no RF
noise.

\subsection{WAPs}

%TODO details about WAPs

We are currently using a Linksys ??? 802.11ac WAP, with SPECs. It is running
VERSION of SOFTWARE, and we have installed iperf3 (see tools) directly on the
router for testing.

We have confirmed that we can enable/disable beamforming, which will
allow us to ensure that we are testing its effects.

\subsection{Clients}

We have a number of devices that can act as
802.11ac clients, including an Apple Macbook Pro, a Microsoft Surface Pro 3,
and two mobile devices, an Apple iPhone 6+ and an Android OnePlus
One.

We have also purchased an ASUS USB 801.11ac dongle so that we can
utilize any other non-ac host as an ac host for testing. While we were
able to benchmark the dongle, due to the driver we were unable to
benchmark it at full speeds. We intend to switch to a linux host for
the dongle, so that we can have finer grained control over the device.
