\section{Resources}

We have a spectrum analyzer that is capable of monitoring 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi signals 
allowing us to see all RF traffic in there spectrums beyond just WiFi.

\subsection{Wireless APs}

We are currently using the latest hardware model of the Linksys WRT1900AC 802.11ac WAP, with a 1.2 GHz dual core ARM
processor and 256MB of DDR3 RAM. It is running OpenWRT Chaos Calmer(Dev Branch) with various tools, such as iperf3 (see tools) 
directly on the router for testing. The OpenWRT platform gives us complete configuration control
and insight into what the AP is doing.

\subsection{Clients}

We have a number of devices that can act as
802.11ac clients, including an Apple Macbook Pro, a Microsoft Surface Pro 3,
and two mobile devices, an Apple iPhone 6+ and an Android OnePlus
One.

We have also purchased a USB 801.11ac dongle so that we can utilize any other
non-ac host as an ac host for testing.
