We have a spectrum analyzer.

\subsection{WAPs}

%TODO details about WAPs

We are currently using a Linksys ??? 802.11ac WAP, with SPECs. It is running
VERSION of SOFTWARE, and we have installed iperf (see tools) directly on the
router for testing.


\subsection{Clients}

We have a number of devices that can act as
802.11ac clients, including an Apple Macbook Pro, a Microsoft Surface Pro 3,
and two mobile devices, an Apple iPhone 6+ and an Android OnePlus
One.

We have also purchased a USB 801.11ac dongle so that we can utilize any other
non-ac host as an ac host for testing.
