We have decided to use iperf3 (both TCP and UDP) to measure bandwidth
and characteristics between machines in our network. Initial tests
were run with one machine hardwired via ethernet to the router running
an iperf server, and the other machine wirelessly connected as an
iperf client. In subsequent tests, we were able to install iperf
directly on the router, and run the server from there. There is some
concern that this will degrade the performance of the router, and we
intend to measure the difference between the two setups to determine
if that is the case.
